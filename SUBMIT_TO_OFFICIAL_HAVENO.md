# How to Submit Your BTC to XMR Transition PR to Official Haveno Repository

## Current Situation
- Your fork is at: `https://github.com/retoaccess1/haveno-reto`
- Official repository is at: `https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno`
- Your branch `btc-to-xmr-transition` has significant changes that need to be submitted upstream

## Option 1: Fork and Create PR (Recommended)

### Step 1: Fork the Official Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno
2. Click "Fork" button (top-right)
3. Create fork under your GitHub account

### Step 2: Update Your Local Repository
After forking, update your local repository to point to your new fork:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/haveno.git

# Verify remotes are set correctly
git remote -v
# Should show:
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/haveno.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/haveno.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno.git (push)
```

### Step 3: Rebase Your Changes (Important!)
Your branch is behind the official master by many commits. You need to rebase:

```bash
# Switch to master and update it
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master

# Rebase your feature branch
git checkout btc-to-xmr-transition
git rebase upstream/master

# Resolve any conflicts that arise during rebase
# After resolving conflicts, continue with:
# git rebase --continue

# Force push to your fork (since rebase rewrites history)
git push -f origin btc-to-xmr-transition
```

### Step 4: Create the Pull Request
1. Go to your fork: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/haveno`
2. Click "Compare & pull request" button
3. Set base repository: `haveno-dex/haveno` base: `master`
4. Set head repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/haveno` compare: `btc-to-xmr-transition`
5. Use the title: **"Complete BTC to XMR transition in CLI and apitest modules"**
6. Copy the content from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` as the PR description

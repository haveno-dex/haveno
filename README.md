## What is Haveno?

Haveno (pronounced haâ€§veâ€§no) is a platform for people who want to exchange [Monero](https://getmonero.org) for fiat currencies like EUR, GBP, and USD or other cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and BCH.

Main features:

- All communications are routed through **Tor**, to preserve your privacy

- Trades are **peer-to-peer**: trades on Haveno will happen between people only, there is no central authority.

- Trades are **non-custodial**: Haveno provides arbitration in case something goes wrong during the trade, but we will never have access to your funds.

- There is **No token**, because we don't need it. Transactions between traders are secured by non-custodial multisignature transactions on the Monero network.

- The revenue generated by Haveno will be managed by an entity called Council (more info soon), composed by members of the Monero/Haveno community, not the Haveno Core Team and will be used to **fund Haveno and Monero** development.

See the [FAQ on our website](https://haveno.exchange/faq/) for more information.

## Status of the project

A live test network is online and users can already run Haveno and make test trades between each others using Monero's stagenet. See the [instructions to build Haveno and connect to the network](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/blob/master/docs/installing.md). Note that Haveno is still very much in development. If you find issues or bugs, please let us know.

Main repositories:

- **[haveno](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno)** - This repository. The core of Haveno.
- **[haveno-ui](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ui)** - The user interface.
- **[haveno-ts](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ts)** - TypeScript library for using Haveno.
- **[haveno-meta](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta)** - For project-wide discussions and proposals.

If you wish to help, take a look at the repositories above and look for open issues. We run a bounty program to incentivize development. See [Bounties](#bounties)

The PGP keys of the core team members are in `gpg_keys/`.

## Bounties

To incentivize development and reward contributors we adopt a simple bounty system. Contributors may be awarded bounties after completing a task (resolving an issue). Take a look at the issues eligible for a bounty on the [dedicated Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/haveno-dex/projects/2) or look for [issues labelled 'ðŸ’°bounty'](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%F0%9F%92%B0bounty) in the main `haveno` repository. [Details and conditions for receiving a bounty](docs/bounties.md).

## Support and sponsorships

## What is Haveno?

Haveno (pronounced haâ€§veâ€§no) is an open source platform to exchange [Monero](https://getmonero.org) for fiat currencies like USD, EUR, and GBP or other cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and BCH.

Main features:

- Communications are routed through **Tor**, to preserve your privacy.

- Trades are **peer-to-peer**: trades on Haveno happen between people only, there is no central authority.

- Trades are **non-custodial**: Haveno supports arbitration in case something goes wrong during the trade, but arbitrators never have access to your funds.

- There is **No token**, because it's not needed. Transactions between traders are secured by non-custodial multisignature transactions on the Monero network.

See the [FAQ on our website](https://haveno.exchange/faq/) for more information.

## Installing Haveno

Haveno can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows by using a third party installer and network.

> [!note]
> The official Haveno repository does not support making real trades directly.
> 
> To make real trades with Haveno, first find a third party network, and then use their installer or build their repository. We do not endorse any networks at this time.

A test network is also available for users to make test trades using Monero's stagenet. See the [instructions](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/blob/master/docs/installing.md) to build Haveno and connect to the test network.

Alternatively, you can [create your own mainnet network](create-mainnet.md).

Note that Haveno is being actively developed. If you find issues or bugs, please let us know.

## Bounties

To incentivize development and reward contributors, we adopt a simple bounty system. Contributors may be awarded bounties after completing a task (resolving an issue). Take a look at the [issues labeled 'ðŸ’°bounty'](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%F0%9F%92%B0bounty) in the main `haveno` repository. [Details and conditions for receiving a bounty](docs/bounties.md).

## Support and sponsorships

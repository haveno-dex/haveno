## What is Haveno?

Haveno (pronounced haâ€§veâ€§no) is a platform for people who want to exchange [Monero](https://getmonero.org) for fiat currencies like EUR, GBP and USD or other cryptocurrencies, like BTC, ETH, BCH .

Main features:

- All communications are routed through **Tor**, to preserve your privacy

- Trades are **peer-to-peer**: trades on Haveno will happen between people only, there is no central authority.

- Trades are **non-custodial**: Haveno provides arbitration in case something goes wrong during the trade, but we will never have access to your funds.

- There is **No token**, because we don't need it. Transactions between traders are secured by non-custodial multisignature transactions on the Monero network.

- The revenue generated by Haveno will be managed by an entity called Council (more info soon), composed by members of the Monero/Haveno community, not the Haveno Core Team and will be used to **fund Haveno and Monero** development.

See the [FAQ on our website](https://haveno.exchange/faq/) for more information.

Haveno is still work in progress. There are no binaries available at this stage. If you want to test Haveno you have to compile it first (see [docs/installing.md](docs/installing.md)).

## Status of the project

Haveno is currently being developed, but it's already possible to test XMR <->fiat/crypto trades using the legacy user interface. The development of Haveno's own user interface was [funded by the Monero community](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/haveno-frontend.html).

The project is divided between multiple repositories:

- **[haveno](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno)** - This repository. The heart of Haveno.
- **[haveno-ui-poc](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ui-poc)** - The PoC of the future user interface. Uses gRPC APIs to serve the UI in React.
- **[haveno-meta](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta)** - For project-wide discussions and proposals.
- **[haveno-site](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-site)** - The repository of the website.

If you wish to help, take a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/issues). We run a bounty program to incentivize development. See [Bounties](#bounties)

The project is lead by a core Team formed of 2 people: ErCiccione and Woodser. The PGP keys of the core team members are in `gpg_keys/`.

## Keep in touch and help out!

Haveno is a community-driven project. For it to be successful it's fundamental to have the support and help of the community. We have our own Matrix server. Registrations are not open at the moment, but the rooms are public and can be joined from any matrix client (like Element).

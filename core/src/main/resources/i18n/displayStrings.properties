# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings

# A annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces. They are there with a purpose!
# To make longer strings with better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the display but only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way a comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to English. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

  Your offer is still available to other traders, so you have not lost the maker fee. \
  You can move this trade to failed trades.
portfolio.pending.failedTrade.missingDepositTx=The deposit transaction (the 2-of-2 multisig transaction) is missing.\n\n\
  Without this tx, the trade cannot be completed. No funds have been locked but your trade fee has been paid. \
  You can make a request to be reimbursed the trade fee here: \
  [HYPERLINK:https://github.com/bisq-network/support/issues]\n\n\
  Feel free to move this trade to failed trades.
portfolio.pending.failedTrade.buyer.existingDepositTxButMissingDelayedPayoutTx=The delayed payout transaction is missing, \
  but funds have been locked in the deposit transaction.\n\n\
  Please do NOT send the traditional or cryptocurrency payment to the XMR seller, because without the delayed payout tx, arbitration \
  cannot be opened. Instead, open a mediation ticket with Cmd/Ctrl+o. \
  The mediator should suggest that both peers each get back the full amount of their security deposits \
  (with seller receiving full trade amount back as well). \
  This way, there is no security risk, and only trade fees are lost. \n\n\
  You can request a reimbursement for lost trade fees here: \

portfolio.pending.failedTrade.seller.existingDepositTxButMissingDelayedPayoutTx=The delayed payout transaction is missing \

  a mediation ticket instead. You should also open a mediation ticket with Cmd/Ctrl+o. \n\n\
  If the buyer has not sent payment yet, the mediator should suggest that both peers each get back the full amount of \
  their security deposits (with seller receiving full trade amount back as well). \

account.crypto.popup.blk-burnt.msg=To trade burnt blackcoins, you need to know the following:\n\n\
Burnt blackcoins are unspendable. To trade them on Haveno, output scripts need to be in the form: \
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA, followed by associated data bytes which, after being hex-encoded, constitute addresses. \
For example, burnt blackcoins with an address 666f6f (“foo” in UTF-8) will have the following script:\n\n\
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA 666f6f\n\n\
To create burnt blackcoins, one may use the “burn” RPC command available in some wallets.\n\n\
For possible use cases, one may look at https://ibo.laboratorium.ee .\n\n\
As burnt blackcoins are unspendable, they can not be reselled. “Selling” burnt blackcoins means \
burning ordinary blackcoins (with associated data equal to the destination address).\n\n\
In case of a dispute, the BLK seller needs to provide the transaction hash.

L-XMR wallet which allows you to obtain the blinding key for your blinded L-XMR address.\n\n\
In the event mediation is necessary, or if a trade dispute arises, you must disclose the blinding key for \
your receiving L-XMR address to the Haveno mediator or refund agent so they can verify the details of \
your Confidential Transaction on their own Elements Core full node.\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the mediator or refund agent will result in losing the \
dispute case. In all cases of dispute, the L-XMR receiver bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in \

  1. Check this page to see if (and how) your bank works with Zelle: [HYPERLINK:https://www.zellepay.com/get-started]\n\n\
  2. Take special note of your transfer limits—sending limits vary by bank, and banks often specify separate daily, weekly, and monthly limits.\n\n\
  3. If your bank does not work with Zelle, you can still use it through the Zelle mobile app, but your transfer limits will be much lower.\n\n\
  4. The name specified on your Haveno account MUST match the name on your Zelle/bank account. \n\n\
  If you cannot complete a Zelle transaction as specified in your trade contract, you may lose some (or all) of your security deposit.\n\n\
  Because of Zelle''s somewhat higher chargeback risk, sellers are advised to contact unsigned buyers through email or SMS to verify that the buyer \
  really owns the Zelle account specified in Haveno.
payment.fasterPayments.newRequirements.info=Some banks have started verifying the receiver''s full name for Faster \
  Payments transfers. Your current Faster Payments account does not specify a full name.\n\n\
  Please consider recreating your Faster Payments account in Haveno to provide future {0} buyers with a full name.\n\n\
  When you recreate the account, make sure to copy the precise sort code, account number and account age verification \
  salt values from your old account to your new account. This will ensure your existing account''s age and signing \
  status are preserved.
payment.moneyGram.info=When using MoneyGram the XMR buyer has to send the Authorisation number and a photo of the receipt by email to the XMR seller. \
  The receipt must clearly show the seller's full name, country, state and the amount. The seller's email will be displayed to the buyer during the trade process.
payment.westernUnion.info=When using Western Union the XMR buyer has to send the MTCN (tracking number) and a photo of the receipt by email to the XMR seller. \

payment.halCash.info=When using HalCash the XMR buyer needs to send the XMR seller the HalCash code via a text message from their mobile phone.\n\n\
  Please make sure to not exceed the maximum amount your bank allows you to send with HalCash. \
  The min. amount per withdrawal is 10 EUR and the max. amount is 600 EUR. For repeated withdrawals it is \
  3000 EUR per receiver per day and 6000 EUR per receiver per month. Please cross-check those limits with your \
  bank to be sure they use the same limits as stated here.\n\n\
  The withdrawal amount must be a multiple of 10 EUR as you cannot withdraw other amounts from an ATM. The \
  UI in the create-offer and take-offer screen will adjust the XMR amount so that the EUR amount is correct. You cannot use market \
  based price as the EUR amount would be changing with changing prices.\n\n\
  In case of a dispute the XMR buyer needs to provide the proof that they sent the EUR.

payment.limits.info=Please be aware that all bank transfers carry a certain amount of chargeback risk. To mitigate this risk, \
  Haveno sets per-trade limits based on the estimated level of chargeback risk for the payment method used.\n\

  \n\

# suppress inspection "UnusedProperty"

  on the following 2 factors:\n\n\

  2. Account signing status\n\
  \n\
  This payment account is not yet signed, so it is limited to buying {0} per trade. \

  ● Before signing, and for 30 days after signing, your per-trade buy limit will be {0}\n\
  ● 30 days after signing, your per-trade buy limit will be {1}\n\
  ● 60 days after signing, your per-trade buy limit will be {2}\n\

- BTC buyers must send the USPMO to the BTC seller with Delivery Confirmation.\n\
\n\
In the event mediation is necessary, or if there is a trade dispute, you will be required to send the photos to the Haveno mediator or refund agent, together with the USPMO Serial Number, Post Office Number, and dollar amount, so they can verify the details on the US Post Office website.\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the Mediator or Arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case.\n\n\
In all dispute cases, the USPMO sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in providing evidence/proof to the Mediator or Arbitrator.\n\n\
If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade using USPMO on Haveno.

payment.payByMail.info=Trading using pay-by-mail (PBM) on Haveno requires that you understand the following:\n\
  \n\
  ● XMR buyer should package cash in a tamper-evident cash bag.\n\
  ● XMR buyer should film or take high-resolution photos of the cash packaging process with the address & tracking number already affixed to packaging.\n\
  ● XMR buyer should send the cash package to the XMR seller with Delivery Confirmation and appropriate Insurance.\n\
  ● XMR seller should film the opening of the package, making sure that the tracking number provided by the sender is visible in the video.\n\
  ● Offer maker must state any special terms or conditions in the 'Additional Information' field of the payment account.\n\
  ● Offer taker agrees to the offer maker's terms and conditions by taking the offer.\n\
  \n\
  PBM trades put the onus to act honestly squarely on both peers.\n\
  \n\
  ● PBM trades have less verifiable actions than other traditional trades. This makes handling dispute much harder.\n\
  ● Try to resolve disputes directly with your peer using trader chat. This is your most promising route to solving any PBM dispute.\n\
  ● Mediators can consider your case and make a suggestion, but they are NOT guaranteed to help.\n\
  ● If a mediator is engaged, and if either peer rejects the mediator's suggestion, both peers' funds will be sent to a Haveno 'donation' address [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Arbitration#Time-Locked_Payout_Transaction], and the trade will effectively be completed.\n\
  ● If a trader rejects a mediation suggestion and opens arbitration, it could lead to a loss of both the trading and the deposit funds.\n\
  ● Arbitrators will make a decision based on the evidence provided to them. Therefore, please follow and document the above processes to have evidence in case of dispute. For Pay by Mail trades the Arbitrators decision is final.\n\
  ● Reimbursement requests any lost funds resulting from Pay By Mail trades to Haveno will NOT be considered.\n\
  \n\
  To be sure you fully understand the requirements of pay-by-mail trades, please see: [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Cash_by_Mail]\n\
  \n\
  If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade using PBM on Haveno.

Countries / regions you would accept trades from (eg France, EU, or any European country); \n\

payment.shared.extraInfo.prompt=Define any special terms, conditions, or details you would like to be displayed with your offers for this payment account (users will see this info before accepting offers).
payment.f2f.info='Face to Face' trades have different rules and come with different risks than online transactions.\n\n\
  The main differences are:\n\
  ● The trading peers need to exchange information about the meeting location and time by using their provided contact details.\n\
  ● The trading peers need to bring their laptops and do the confirmation of 'payment sent' and 'payment received' at the meeting place.\n\
  ● If a maker has special 'terms and conditions' they must state those in the 'Additional information' text field in the account.\n\
  ● By taking an offer the taker agrees to the maker's stated 'terms and conditions'.\n\
  ● In case of a dispute the mediator or arbitrator cannot be of much assistance as it is usually difficult to get tamper-proof evidence \
  of what happened at the meeting. In such cases the XMR funds might get locked indefinitely or until the trading peers come to \
  an agreement.\n\n\
  To be sure you fully understand the differences with 'Face to Face' trades please read the instructions and \
  recommendations at: [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Face-to-face_(payment_method)]

payment.amazonGiftCard.info=To pay with Amazon eGift Card, you will need to send an Amazon eGift Card to the XMR seller via your Amazon account. \n\n\
  Please see the wiki [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Amazon_eGift_card] for further details and best practices. \n\n\
  Three important notes:\n\
  - try to send gift cards with amounts of 100 USD or smaller, as Amazon is known to flag larger gift cards as fraudulent\n\
  - try to use creative, believable text for the gift card''s message (e.g., "Happy birthday Susan!") along with the trade ID (and use trader chat \
  to tell your trading peer the reference text you picked so they can verify your payment)\n\
  - Amazon eGift Cards can only be redeemed on the Amazon website they were purchased on (e.g., a gift card purchased on amazon.it can only be redeemed on amazon.it)

NAME
----
keepfunds - keep XMR received during a trade in Haveno wallet

SYNOPSIS
--------
keepfunds
		--trade-id=<trade-id>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A XMR buyer completes the final step in the trade protocol by keeping received XMR in his
Haveno wallet.  This step may not seem necessary from the buyer's perspective, but it is
necessary for correct transition of a trade's state to CLOSED, within the Haveno server.

The alternative way to close out the trade is to send the received XMR to an external
XMR wallet, using the withdrawfunds command.

OPTIONS
-------
--trade-id
		The ID of the trade (the full offer-id).

EXAMPLES
--------
A XMR seller has informed the buyer that fiat payment has been received for trade with ID
83e8b2e2-51b6-4f39-a748-3ebd29c22aea, and locked XMR has been released to the buyer.
The XMR buyer closes out the trade by keeping the received XMR in her Haveno wallet:
$ ./haveno-cli --password=xyz --port=9998 keepfunds --trade-id=83e8b2e2-51b6-4f39-a748-3ebd29c22aea

# Running a Local Monero Node

For the best experience using Haveno, it is highly recommended to run your own local Monero node to improve security and responsiveness.

By default, Haveno will automatically connect to a local node if it is detected. Otherwise, Haveno will connect to one of several pre-configured remote nodes unless manually configured otherwise.

Additionally, Haveno will automatically start and connect to your local Monero node if it was last used and is currently offline.

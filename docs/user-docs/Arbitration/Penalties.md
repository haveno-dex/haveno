# Table of penalties

Haveno has Rules in place to make the trading process as safe and convenient as possible for all parties involved, and it is important those rules are followed by users.

Penalties are a percentage of the trade amount, deducted from the offending peer's security deposit (and when needed, also from trade amount itself) and offered as a compensation to the other peer during the Dispute resolution process The actual penalty will be up to the values detailed below, depending on security deposit % and 's discretion.

100% penalties are for serious violations and will always imply losing the whole amount (trade + deposit).

If two or more penalties are caused by the buyer or seller the penalty amount will be greater of the amounts. Penalties are not cumulative.

Ideally, if good communication is established, peers can use trader chat to agree on a penalty amount to relay to their.

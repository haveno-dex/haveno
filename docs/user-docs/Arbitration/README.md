# Dispute resolution

Sometimes Haveno trades don't go smoothly, and dispute resolution is required to determine an outcome.

Dispute resolution on Haveno has 2 formal levels: trader chat, and arbitration.

Most issues on Haveno are minor and easily resolved when traders communicate with each other. Mediation is intended to resolve the vast majority of remaining issues. Arbitration is a rare last resort measure for extreme scenarios.

#### Level 1: Trader chat

If you're having any issues completing a trade, or if you just want to keep your counterparty informed (e.g., in case you're delayed completing your end of the deal), you can send your counterparty a message through Haveno's end-to-end encrypted chat mechanism.

This allows traders to communicate with each other throughout the course of a trade to resolve potential trade issues quickly without involving a third party like a mediator or arbitrator.

#### 1.1 Trader chat rules

#### 1.1.1 Good communication is key

Good communication between traders can resolve most disputes. It is recommended for traders to communicate to their peers any issues they are having to keep their peer informed.

#### 1.1.2 However, responding to chat messages is always optional

If you’re not comfortable responding to chat messages, don’t respond. You have no obligation to communicate over this medium with traders. You have to respond to mediator's dispute and arbitators when needed.

#### 1.1.3 Do not send links of any kind

For safety. If you want to send a link, describe it instead.

#### 1.1.4 Do not encourage trading away from Haveno
Trades away from Haveno lack Haveno’s security mechanisms. If something goes wrong with an off-Haveno trade, you’re on your own.

#### 1.1.5 Do not send sensitive information like private keys, passwords, etc
Such information is never wise to share in general, and is never needed to solve trade disputes on Haveno.

#### 1.1.6 Do not engage in foul play
Any attempts to exploit counterparties with social engineering scams, etc. are prohibited and sanctionned by a security deposit penalty.

#### 1.1.7 Respect a peer’s decision to avoid responding
If a peer seems unresponsive, or has signaled their intention to refrain from chatting, please respect it and don’t pressure them.

#### 1.1.8 Keep conversation scope limited to the trade
Please don’t use Haveno’s trader chat as a general-purpose messenger. Unnecessary exchanges add unnecessary strain to Haveno’s peer-to-peer network.

#### 1.1.9 Keep conversation friendly and respectful
Because friendlier traders resolve disputes quicker, and no one wants to deal with a jerk.

Hopefully, by following these rules, you can work directly with your trading peer to solve issues quickly and amicably.

#### Level 2: Arbitration
Reject mediator's suggestion in order to start arbitration.

Arbitration is the last formal layer of dispute resolution on Haveno. It is meant to be rare. If the measures described below sound extreme, it’s because they are only meant to be employed for extreme circumstances.

- Arbitration is only available when the trading authorized delay has been reached or by manually opening a dispute.
- Arbitration is here to sign the payout transaction of the multisig shared trade.

Practically, here’s how arbitration works:
- If you are trading with an unresponsive peer, open a dispute to request arbitration.
- Collaborate with the arbitrator to clarify the details of your case.
- If the arbitrator sides with you, they will make the payout transaction to your side.

Arbitrators are required to respond to messages within 5 days, so it may take a bit longer for them to respond than mediators (you should still respond to messages within 2 days).

#### 3. If all else fails

One advantage of a flat, decentralized governance structure that encourages user involvement is that no user should ever feel hindered from receiving a fair trade outcome because of a single individual's decision. Haveno isn't a black-box corporation with inscrutable processes. It's an open software project that is governed openly.

- Therefore, for whatever reason, if the process above doesn't work for you, you can make a reimbursement request yourself in to the Haveno team (the reimbursement will be up to their choice depending of the request gravity).

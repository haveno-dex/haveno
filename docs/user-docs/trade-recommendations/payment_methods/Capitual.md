#### What are CapCodes?

Transfers take place using CapCodes. CapCodes are like coupon codes you can generate at any time and use it to transfer funds

CapCodes are an electronic cheque system that makes it possible to store amounts of money, precious metals or cryupto-currencies in a short code, easy to be written down, that can be written in a piece of paper to make transactions even when you are not connected to the internet.

When you generate a CapCode, you get a voucher (coupon code) that you must take note (don’t worry: it’s always possible to recover a CapCode that you have lost!). Such code stores funds in any of the currencies supported by Capitual, and you can share it with someone else, allowing the payment in any of these currencies. It’s needed to have a Capitual account to redeem a CapCode.

After generating a CapCode, the amount gets “locked in”, and is already deducted from your balance. If you have given up or will no longer need to use the CapCode, you can redeem it yourself, onto your own account. It’s also possible to track, from your account, whether a CapCode has already been redeemed.

CapCodes are only available when accessing your account using a computer.

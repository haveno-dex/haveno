#### Creating the account in Haveno

To create an Interac e-Transfer payment account in Haveno, Buyers and Sellers must add your full account name, email or mobile #, as well as a secret question and answer which is used to accept payments.

#### Using Interac e-Transfer for Haveno trades

This payment method is very easy to use and will normally have a very fast turnaround time.

#### If buying Monero with fiat:

After accepting the trade and waiting for at least 1 blockchain confirmation (the more confirmations the safer) you would proceed to your Canadian bank account. From there (options and method may vary depending on financial institution) you would select Email Money. You must then create a new contact using your trading partners contact details (found in Haveno). Please make sure to never mention anything related to Monero since this may generate questions from your bank. When creating a new contact make sure the details match exactly, especially the secret question/answer and email, since this is the only way for your trading partner to claim the funds. Leave the message/description field blank unless you have agreed otherwise with your trading peer in trader chat. Ensure that you are sending the exact sum listed in Haveno. Once you've sent the transfer, you may click on Payment Started in Haveno.

####Â If selling Monero for fiat:

After your trade has been accepted and your transaction confirmed, the taker will initiate the Interac e-Transfer. You may receive it within minutes, however you may take up to the trade time limit to accept it. Once you've accepted it you may click on Confirm Payment in Haveno to release the Monero. It is imperative that you confirm receipt in Haveno, otherwise the Monero will not be released and the trade may unnecessarily end up in mediation.

#### Ease of use

This payment method is very practical and streamlined, after you've set up an email contact for Interac e-Tranfers, subsequent trades with the same Haveno trading partner become extremely quick and easy.
